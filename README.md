# SearchingVisualizer

Another common theme in computer science problems is the task of searching for an element in a list, array or other data structure. There are countless search algorithms depending on the task at hand, I've implemented a couple common ones below.

Linear search is the most basic search algorithm out there. Simply check every value against your key until you've either found it or exhausted your set!

Binary search is a special search algorithm in that it only works on sorted data, but is significantly faster when searching as it only has to compare to at most log2(number of data points)!
